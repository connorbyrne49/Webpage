    <p align="right"> Over the last five years, I have worked as an ocean lifeguard for the Town of Hempstead.  I was recognized at an early age with exceptional proficiency in water rescue techniques, emergency medical training and the general saftey of the public. I was promoted to
    a leuitenant and directly put in charge of thirty other lifeguards. As a leuitenant it is my job to serve as a role model and to control all aspects of a chaotic situation.</p>
