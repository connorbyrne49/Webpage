        <p align="right">
        Hello, my name is Connor Byrne. I am currently an undergraduate student at Molloy College in Rockville Centre, New York. 
      I am majoring in computer science and minoring in both spanish and mathematics. I have a strong passion for learning and achieving 
      high academic standards. If I could have a <q>superpower</q> as a professional, it would be my keen ability to analyze complex problems and to
      think creatively while effectively coming to a solution. </p>
        <p align="right"> Outside of academics, I have many interests and hobbies that help to define me as an indiviual. I believe to be passionate about
      something is to be alive. I endure myself to be a simple man, enjoying the many pleasures of daily life.  I'm an advid reader of all 
      genres, an acoustic guitarist, an expert surfer, trained ocean rescue professional, a brother, a son and most importantly a friend to all.
